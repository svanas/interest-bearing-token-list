# interest-bearing-token-list

Uniswap token list for ERC20 tokens that (a) are pegged to a stablecoin, and (b) accrue interest in real time.

Interest-bearing tokens continuously go up in value as you hold them. They represent a share in a lending pool that grows in size as borrowers pay interest into them.

Interest-bearing tokens can be traded, used as collateral, composed by developers into structured products, or sent to cold storage for safety.
