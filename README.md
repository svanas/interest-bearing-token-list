# interest-bearing-token-list

[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) token list for ERC20 tokens that (a) are pegged to a stablecoin, and (b) accrue interest in real time.

### What are interest-bearing tokens?

Interest-bearing tokens continuously go up in value as you hold them. They represent a share in a lending pool that grows in size as borrowers pay interest into them.

### Besides passive income, what is the use-case for them?

Interest-bearing tokens can be traded, used as collateral, composed by developers into structured products, or sent to cold storage for safety.
