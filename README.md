### What are interest-bearing tokens?

Interest-bearing tokens continuously go up in value as you hold them. They represent a share in a lending pool that grows in size as borrowers pay interest into them.

### Besides passive income, what is the use-case for them?

Interest-bearing tokens can be traded, used as collateral, composed by developers into structured products, or sent to cold storage for safety.
